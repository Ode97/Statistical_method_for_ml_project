Risk analysis of 4 neural networks with different hyperparameters on Kaggle's Muffin vs. Chihuahua dataset with 5 fold cross validation.

Python version required: 3.10.12

After cloning the repo, move to the project folder and follow the following steps.

Create the environment with Anaconda (version 23.9.0) using the .yml file provided:
```conda env create -f environment.yml```.

Activate the environment:
```conda activate smfmlproject```.

Access Jupyter notebook:
```jupyter notebook```.


The code contains the download of the dataset from kaggle, but you need to register on Kaggle, then download the token from the Settings page clicking "Create New Token", and finally put it in the ```~\.kaggle folder```.

Finally open the file cross_val_experiment.ipynb and press the Kernel key and select Restart and Run All.
